# FinBuddy Stealth-Blade Architecture: Zero-Trust Implementation

This document details how the FinBuddy architecture implements stealth and zero-trust security principles at each layer of the system. The Stealth-Blade pattern minimizes the public attack surface while ensuring that every component operates under the assumption that the network environment is hostile.

## 1. Network Layer Security

### 1.1 Perimeter Protection
- **Single Entry Point**: API Gateway serves as the only public-facing component
- **Edge TLS Termination**: All external traffic terminates TLS at the API Gateway
- **Network Isolation**: Private subnets for all internal services with no direct internet access
- **Network Policy Enforcement**: K8s Network Policies restrict pod-to-pod communication based on service identity

### 1.2 Service Mesh Implementation
- **Mutual TLS (mTLS)**: Mandatory encrypted connections between all services via Istio
- **Certificate Rotation**: Automatic short-lived certificate rotation (24-hour lifetime)
- **Traffic Encryption**: All east-west traffic encrypted regardless of underlying network
- **Protocol Validation**: HTTP/gRPC traffic validation with schema enforcement

## 2. Authentication & Authorization

### 2.1 External Authentication
- **OAuth2/OIDC**: Industry-standard authentication via Keycloak/Auth0
- **JWT Validation**: Cryptographically signed tokens with short TTL (15 minutes)
- **MFA Enforcement**: Mandatory multi-factor authentication for all user accounts
- **Device Fingerprinting**: Registration of trusted devices with anomaly detection

### 2.2 Service-to-Service Authentication
- **Service Accounts**: Each blade operates with dedicated service account credentials
- **Identity Verification**: Istio validates service identity via X.509 certificates
- **Authorization Policies**: Fine-grained policies defining which services can call which endpoints
- **Credential Isolation**: Service credentials never shared between blades

## 3. Data Security

### 3.1 Encryption Strategy
- **Data-at-Rest Encryption**: AES-256 encryption for all database records
- **Transparent Database Encryption**: PostgreSQL with encrypted tablespaces
- **Encryption Key Management**: External KMS (HashiCorp Vault) with automatic key rotation
- **Envelope Encryption**: Data encryption keys (DEKs) wrapped by master keys

### 3.2 Data Access Controls
- **Data Blade Pattern**: All database access centralized through the Data Blade
- **Field-Level Encryption**: Sensitive fields encrypted with user-specific keys
- **Just-in-Time Decryption**: Data decrypted only when needed and in memory
- **Data Lifecycle**: Automated purging of stale data based on retention policies

## 4. Blade Isolation

### 4.1 Service Isolation
- **Single Responsibility**: Each blade performs a specific domain function
- **Container Sandboxing**: Resource limits, no privilege escalation, read-only filesystems
- **Runtime Protection**: AppArmor/Seccomp profiles limiting system calls
- **Blast Radius Limitation**: Failure or compromise of one blade doesn't affect others

### 4.2 Dependencies & Supply Chain
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Each blade uses only necessary libraries
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD
- **Container Signing**: All container images cryptographically signed
- **Image Scanning**: Scanning for vulnerabilities before deployment

## 5. Cloud-Sync & Offline-First Security

### 5.1 Offline Mode Security
- **Local Encryption**: On-device data encrypted with device-specific keys
- **Secure Enclave**: Sensitive data stored in OS secure storage when available
- **Attestation**: Device integrity verification before syncing
- **Selective Sync**: Minimum necessary data synchronized to device

### 5.2 Sync Security
- **Conflict Resolution**: Cryptographically verified conflict resolution
- **Differential Privacy**: Noise addition to sensitive aggregated data
- **Transport Security**: TLS 1.3 with certificate pinning for sync operations
- **Sync Authorization**: Fine-grained permissions for sync operations

## 6. Defense in Depth Measures

### 6.1 Monitoring & Detection
- **Distributed Tracing**: Trace-based anomaly detection via Jaeger
- **Log Aggregation**: Centralized logging with alert patterns
- **Runtime Behavior Analysis**: Monitoring for unusual service behavior
- **Rate Limiting**: Both API and service-level rate limiting

### 6.2 Response Controls
- **Circuit Breaking**: Automatic isolation of failing services
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback mechanisms when dependencies fail
- **Auto-Remediation**: Self-healing capabilities for common failure scenarios
- **Audit Logging**: Immutable audit trail of all security-relevant events

## 7. CI/CD Security

### 7.1 Infrastructure as Code
- **GitOps Workflow**: Infrastructure defined and version controlled
- **Least Privilege**: Tight RBAC controls on deployment permissions
- **Ephemeral Credentials**: Short-lived credentials for CI/CD processes
- **IaC Scanning**: Security scanning of Terraform and Helm charts

### 7.2 Deployment Controls
- **Deployment Gating**: Security tests as deployment gates
- **Immutable Infrastructure**: No changes to running containers
- **Blue/Green Deployments**: Zero-downtime deployments with verification
- **Canary Analysis**: Security metrics in canary deployment evaluation

## 8. AI Security

### 8.1 AI Inference Protection
- **Prompt Injection Prevention**: Input sanitization and validation
- **Model Access Control**: Zero-trust access to model weights and parameters
- **Inference Isolation**: Dedicated resources for AI workloads
- **Output Filtering**: Detection and filtering of harmful outputs

### 8.2 Privacy-Preserving AI
- **Federated Learning**: On-device model improvements without data sharing
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data used for model training/inference
- **Purpose Limitation**: Clear boundaries on data usage for AI functions
- **Explainability**: Transparency in AI decision factors

## Implementation in Kubernetes

The zero-trust principles are implemented through:

1. **Istio Service Mesh**: For mTLS, traffic policies, and authentication
2. **Kubernetes RBAC**: Fine-grained access control for all resources
3. **Network Policies**: Explicit allowlist for inter-service communication
4. **Secret Management**: External secrets manager with just-in-time delivery
5. **Pod Security Policies**: Enforcing container security best practices

This comprehensive security posture ensures that FinBuddy maintains user privacy and financial data security while providing AI-powered insights.
